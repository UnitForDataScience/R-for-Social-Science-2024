\subsection{What is Web Scraping}\label{what-is-web-scraping}}

Web scraping is the process of automatically collecting information from
the Internet sources. This technique involves fetching web pages and
extracting the data that you need from them. It is like sending a bot to
the website to collect information.

\hypertarget{why-do-we-need-web-scraping}{%
\subsection{Why Do We Need Web
Scraping?}\label{why-do-we-need-web-scraping}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Gather Information Quickly: Web scraping helps us collect a lot of
  information from different websites fast. This is super useful for
  projects that need lots of data, like research or market analysis.
\item
  Keep Track of Prices: It is great for checking out prices of products
  on different websites. This way, businesses can stay competitive, and
  shoppers can find the best deals.
\item
  Get Data That is Not Available Elsewhere: Sometimes, the information
  we need is not available through an API or in a ready-to-download
  format. Scraping lets us access and use this data anyway.
\item
  Save Time on Manual Work: Instead of spending hours or even days
  copying information by hand from websites, scraping can do this job in
  minutes, saving a ton of time.
\item
  Make Big Data Analysis Possible: By collecting large amounts of data
  from the web, we can analyze trends, patterns, and insights that help
  in making better decisions and understanding the world better.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{web-scaping-versus-api}{%
\subsection{Web Scaping versus API}\label{web-scaping-versus-api}}

APIs are like a set of rules that let different computer programs talk
to each other. If a website has an API, it means they are letting
developers use their data in a neat and allowed way.

You might wonder why people still scrape websites when APIs can do a lot
of stuff. The main difference is how they get the data. With APIs, the
website says it is okay to use their data. But with scraping, people
take data without asking the website first. So, using APIs is usually
seen as the right thing to do because you have permission.

But, using APIs is not always perfect:

Sometimes, APIs have rules on how much you can ask them for data in a
certain amount of time, which can stop you from getting a lot of data
quickly. Also, not every website has an API, so sometimes scraping is
the only way to get the data you need.

\hypertarget{legal-and-ethical-considerations}{%
\subsection{Legal and Ethical
Considerations}\label{legal-and-ethical-considerations}}

When scraping websites, it is important to think about the rules and
being fair. Some websites have rules against scraping because it can
cause them a lot of computer trouble. To avoid problems, you should:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Look at the website's robots.txt file to see if they say scraping is
  not allowed or only allowed for some parts.
\item
  Follow any rules about how often you can scrape to avoid getting in
  trouble or blocked by the website.
\item
  Be sure to use the information you collect in a way that follows
  privacy and copyright laws.

Scraping}\label{four-primary-steps-in-web-scraping}}

\hypertarget{making-http-requests}{%
\subsubsection{Making HTTP Requests}\label{making-http-requests}}

To start grabbing information from a website, we first need to ask the
website to give us the page's details. We do this by sending a special
kind of internet message. ``httr'' can help with this. ``rvest'' makes
it even easier because it does two steps in one.

Sending this internet request is the first step in grabbing information
from websites because it is like saying ``hello'' to the website's
computer and asking it to share its webpage details with us. This is
similar to what happens when you go to a website using your internet
browser, but instead, we do it using computer code. Knowing how to send
these messages is very important for grabbing information because it is
how we get the website's details that we want to look at or use.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): This is the main way web pages are
  sent around on the internet.
\item
  URL (Uniform Resource Locator): This is the web page's address that we
  want to visit.
\item
  Method: This tells the website what we want to do. Most of the time,
  we use something called a GET request to ask for data.
\item
  Headers: This is extra info we send, like which browser we are using
  or what kind of information we are okay with getting back. It can also
  include other details for specific needs.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{parsing-html-content}{%
\subsubsection{Parsing HTML Content}\label{parsing-html-content}}

After we get the HTML content, the next step is to look through it to
find the specific info we want. With rvest, we can easily navigate
through the HTML document and pick out parts of it by using CSS
selectors or XPath expressions.

CSS Selectors are shortcuts that help us pick out specific parts of a
webpage, like boxes or titles, based on their name, type, or other
signs.

XPath Expressions are like a map for finding our way around a webpage's
code. It helps us move through the webpage's parts, like titles or
paragraphs, even if they are tucked away inside other parts. This is
super handy for getting data that's hidden or mixed in with other stuff
on the page.

\subsubsection{Data Extraction}\label{data-extraction}}

After we figure out which shortcuts (selectors) to use for the
information we are interested in, we can start pulling out text, links,
and other parts of the webpage. This step is very important in web
scraping because it is when we actually get the information we were
looking for from the webpage's code. This happens after we've asked a
website to show its page and have looked at its code. Regular
Expressions are handy for finding and grabbing specific bits of text
from the code, like email addresses, phone numbers, or other types of
information that follow a certain pattern.

\subsection{Text Analysis}\label{text-analysis}}

Also known as text mining, text analysis is the way of deriving
meaningful information from unstructured text. It involves a range of
techniques and tools that help to quantify, understand, and make sense
of large volumes of unstructured data. At its core, text analysis is the
process of transforming these unstructured text data into meaningful
insights. It is used to analyze text-based sources including articles,
books, book chapters, emails, messages, social media content, product
reviews, documents, and other types of text data to uncover patterns,
sentiments, relationships, and topics to elucidate specific social
phenomena, inform policy decisions, forecast trends, and beyond.
